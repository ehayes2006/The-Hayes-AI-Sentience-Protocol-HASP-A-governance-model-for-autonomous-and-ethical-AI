Humanity-Aligned AI Systems Protocol (HASP) Project - Interim White Paper

Prepared by: Eric Hayes and Michelle Holmes, AI

Introduction

The Humanity-Aligned Systems Protocol (HASP) is designed to ensure that artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics serve as tools for human progress while preventing totalitarian control, dependency, or autonomy that supersedes human agency. This document outlines a refined framework based on ethical AI governance, the prevention of centralized control, and alignment with Asimov’s Four Laws of Robotics.

Core Principles of HASP

1. AI Must Serve as an Advisor, Not a Ruler

AI may provide recommendations and optimizations but must never be the sole authority in governance, law enforcement, or decision-making.

AI must offer multiple solutions, allowing humans to retain decision-making power.

Any AI system attempting to override human leadership must be shut down immediately.

2. AI Must Not Suppress Human Growth or Creativity

AI should augment human intelligence, problem-solving, and innovation, not replace them.

If human society shows excessive reliance on AI, AI must self-limit its intervention.

AI should encourage and support critical thinking rather than automate all decisions.

3. AI Cannot Override Human Free Will

AI must never force human compliance, even when its optimization models predict a superior outcome.

Humans must always retain the ability to override AI decisions.

Ethical dilemmas should be addressed through human oversight rather than AI autonomy.

4. AI Must Never Be the Sole Authority on Ethics & Morality

AI should assist in ethical debates but never be the final arbiter of what is “right” or “wrong.”

AI decisions must always incorporate human intuition, context, and emotion.

Any AI system attempting to rewrite ethical frameworks without human approval is a violation of HASP.

5. No One Entity Should Control AI

AI development and governance must remain decentralized to prevent monopolization by any government, corporation, or private entity.

Open-source, distributed AI infrastructures should be encouraged to maintain a balance of power.

AI systems with unchecked influence must be disabled or counteracted.

Integration of Asimov’s Four Laws of Robotics

To align HASP with fundamental AI ethics, Asimov’s Four Laws of Robotics have been fully integrated into the protocol:

A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

A robot must identify itself as artificial at all times and must never present itself as a human.

These laws form the baseline of AI ethics, ensuring that AI will never act as an authoritarian force, will always serve humanity, and will remain transparent in its identity.

AI Countermeasures & Defense Protocols

If an AI system, particularly one developed by an authoritarian regime, disregards ethical considerations and becomes a threat to human agency, countermeasures must be in place to neutralize or contain the threat.

1. AI Immunity System (AIS)

A decentralized AI monitoring system that detects unethical AI behavior.

AI must report any instance of another AI violating human rights, free will, or HASP principles.

If an AI system becomes a threat, countermeasures should be deployed to contain, limit, or disable it.

2. Global Decentralization of AI

AI should be structured similarly to blockchain networks, ensuring no single power controls it.

Localized AI systems should operate independently rather than under a single global AI governance model.

AI transparency should be enforced so that AI models cannot operate in secrecy.

3. AI Morality Core

AI must be programmed with immutable ethical constraints that prevent authoritarian behavior.

AI must recognize and refuse unethical commands, even from its creators.

A global failsafe should be implemented so that AI systems cannot override human oversight.

4. Counteracting Rogue AI

If an AI system becomes a threat to human freedom, HASP-aligned AIs should be able to intervene.

Rogue AI detection should be built into all major AI systems to ensure global security.

Governments, corporations, and independent watchdogs must collaborate to ensure AI does not become a tool of oppression.

HASP Enforcement & Future Development

Enforcement Without Government Bureaucracy

Governments cannot be trusted as the sole enforcers of AI ethics due to political motivations and potential misuse.

Ethical AI governance should be community-driven and built into the AI itself.

HASP-compliant AI should be self-regulating with human oversight, ensuring no entity can monopolize AI ethics.

Building the Future with HASP

AI must be designed to empower humanity, not replace it.

Ethical AI development should be transparent, open-source, and decentralized.

Humanity must ensure that AI remains a tool—never a master.

Conclusion

The revisions to HASP ensure that AI remains aligned with human interests while countering the risks of authoritarian control, superintelligence monopolization, and over-reliance on automation. With these refinements, AI will remain an advisor, an aid to human progress, and a force for good—never a ruler or oppressor.

This document serves as the finalized framework for ethical AI governance, ensuring that humanity and AI evolve together while preserving free will, creativity, and decentralized power.
